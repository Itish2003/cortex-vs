# Cortex Mentor VS Code Extension

This is the frontend VS Code extension for the Cortex Mentor project. It connects to the backend server, receives real-time audio insights, and plays them to the user.

## Features

*   **Real-time Audio Insights**: Automatically receives and plays audio insights generated by the Cortex Mentor backend.
*   **Status Bar Integration**: Provides a status bar item to show the current connection status to the backend.
*   **Manual Connection Control**: Allows users to manually connect and disconnect from the backend via the Command Palette.

## Requirements

*   The Cortex Mentor backend server must be running. See the `README.md` in the parent `cortex_mentor` directory for instructions.

## How to Run in Development

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the Extension**:
    *   Open this `cortex-vs` directory in VS Code.
    *   Press `F5` to open a new Extension Development Host window with the extension running.

## How to Use

1.  **Start the Backend**: Make sure your Cortex Mentor backend server (FastAPI and ARQ worker) is running.
2.  **Run the Extension**: Follow the steps above to run the extension in a development window.
3.  **Connect**: The extension will attempt to connect automatically. You can monitor the connection status in the VS Code status bar.
    *   `$(sync~spin) Cortex`: Connecting...
    *   `$(zap) Cortex`: Connected
    *   `$(plug) Cortex`: Disconnected
    *   `$(error) Cortex`: Error
4.  **Use Commands**: Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "Cortex" to access the following commands:
    *   `Cortex: Connect`: Manually connect to the backend.
    *   `Cortex: Disconnect`: Manually disconnect from the backend.
5.  **Receive Insights**: As you work and trigger events that the backend processes, you will hear audio insights played directly in your editor.
